When evaluating an investment opportunity, I undertake a structured and disciplined process to assess both the qualitative and quantitative dimensions. My approach, honed through years in equity research, investment management, and AI-led analytics, typically includes the following core tasks:

---

### 1. **Define the Investment Thesis**

* Identify the **core value proposition** of the business or asset.
* Understand the **market context**: Is it a disruptive technology? A recovery play? A structural compounder?

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Business model and product/service overview (latest company deck or investor presentation)
- [ ] Customer segments and use cases (breakdown of target markets, key client profiles)
- [ ] Management's vision and mission statement (CEO letters, strategic plan excerpts)
- [ ] Sector and industry classification (GICS/NAICS codes)

---

### 2. **Financial Due Diligence**

* **Balance Sheet**: Liquidity, gearing, capital structure, asset quality.
* **Profitability Metrics**: Margins, return on equity, return on capital employed.
* **Cash Flow**: Free cash flow generation, working capital efficiency.
* **Valuation**: DCF, peer multiples, sum-of-the-parts, scenario analysis.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Full financial statements for the last 3–5 years (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement)
- [ ] Notes to the financials (especially around leases, impairments, segment reporting)
- [ ] Revenue breakdown by product, geography, and channel
- [ ] Cost structure details (COGS, SG&A, R&D breakdowns)
- [ ] Cash conversion cycle and working capital movements
- [ ] Net debt position and interest coverage ratios
- [ ] Capex history and projections
- [ ] Share count history and dilution analysis
- [ ] Existing valuation reports or models (DCF assumptions, peer comp tables)

### 3. **Industry and Competitive Analysis**

* Market size, growth drivers, and regulatory landscape.
* SWOT and Porter’s Five Forces to evaluate **competitive moat**.
* Benchmarking against **peers and incumbents**.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Market research reports on total addressable market (TAM) and serviceable obtainable market (SOM)
- [ ] List of direct and indirect competitors with product comparisons
- [ ] Competitive positioning map (market share, pricing, brand strength)
- [ ] Porter’s Five Forces summary
- [ ] Industry growth drivers and constraints (regulatory shifts, tech cycles)
- [ ] Industry-specific KPIs (e.g. occupancy rate for real estate, RPO for SaaS)

---

### 4. **Management & Governance Assessment**

* Track record of **capital allocation** and strategic execution.
* Skin in the game: **Insider ownership** and alignment.
* Governance practices, board composition, and incentive structures.

**Checklist:**

### 5. **Risk Assessment**

---

### 6. **AI and Data Insight Integration (where applicable)**

* Apply **machine learning models** to identify unstructured insights (e.g., text from filings, sentiment, etc.).
* Use predictive analytics to gauge **earnings risk**, **price inflections**, or **alternative data signals**.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Full-text filings (annual reports, earnings call transcripts, trading updates)
- [ ] News flow and sentiment datasets (Bloomberg, Refinitiv, social media APIs)
- [ ] Review and ratings data (Trustpilot, Glassdoor, App Store)
- [ ] Analyst commentary and forecast divergence
- [ ] Access to API feeds or structured data export (CSV/XML/JSON)

### 7. **Exit Strategy and Liquidity Considerations**

* Identify **entry/exit points**, holding periods, and catalysts.
* Liquidity profile of the asset or equity—especially important in small caps or private deals.

**Checklist:**
